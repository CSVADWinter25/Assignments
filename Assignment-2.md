### Create a repeating wallpaper

1. Using Processing, create a program that generates a wallpaper pattern. 

    You may choose to vary one of the example sketches, or write an entirely new program. Your only constraint is that your design must have some form of repetition including symmetrical repetition, a grid structure, or self-similarity (recursion).

    You can use iteration or recursion (or a combination of the two), and your pattern can incorporate Processing shape primitives, or import bitmap or vector 	designs.

2. Export 3 screenshots of your pattern at 3 different scales / resolutions. 

    For example, if you are using a grid, do a 10x10 grid, a 20 x 20 grid, and a 100 x 100 grid.

3. Write a 1 paragraph description of how you arrived at the final pattern.  

    What choices you made about the structure of the design, etc.?

4. Upload your Processing code and screenshots of your three different wallpaper resolutions to your GitHub repository in the week2 directory. Also upload a text or markdown document with your 1 paragraph description. Please upload this material by 10:00 AM Monday morning. We will review the wallpapers in class on Monday, January 20th.
