# Create a Parametric 3D Form

1. Using the 3D mode in Processing, create a parameterized 3D form
    The form can be a variation of the designs demonstrated in class, or a new 3D design that you create using the Processing 3D primitives and shapes. You can create a form that is abstract (i.e. an amorphous shape) or representational (i.e. a chair). 

2. Your program must include the following:
    * An explicit set of constraints- i.e. the constants in your design
    * At least one degree of freedom- i.e. the variables in your design
    * A simple interface that exposes these variables for exploration or tuning. This can include a set of sliders for continuous values, a gallery that generates a range, or something that combines these approaches.
3. Chose three "successful" outcomes from your parametric system and save screenshots of them.

4. After creating your design, write a 1 paragraph description of how you chose the constraints and degrees of freedom in your design.

5. Upload your Processing code, screenshots to your GitHub repository in the week4 directory. Also upload a text or markdown document with your 1 paragraph description. Please upload this material by 10:00 AM Monday morning. We will try out your parametric systems in class on Monday, February 3rd.
