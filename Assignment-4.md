### Generative Design

- Create a Parametric Design that incorporates some form of noise or external input and produce 3 variations with it.

- Your design can build off the examples presented in class, extend your parametric form from the previous assignment, or build off the random and noise examples presented in Bohnacker's [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/). 

- Your program must include the following:

    - A set of user-controlled parameters and a simple interface that exposes these parameter for tuning

    - At least one generative input i.e. random numbers, Perlin noise, a Gaussian distribution, or another form of generative input that is constrained, scaled, or otherwise shaped by the user controlled parameters.

- By modifying the parameters of your design, create 3 variations. These variations should strive to be as visually-distinctive from one another as possible.

- Write a 1 paragraph description of how you chose to incorporate the random or noise-based properties of your design.

- Upload your Processing code and screenshots to your GitHub repository in the week5 directory. Also upload a text or markdown document with your 1 paragraph description. Please upload this material by 10:00 AM Monday morning.
