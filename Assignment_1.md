# Draw a face with code / Draw a face by hand

1. Install the [Processing](https://processing.org/download) programming environment.

2. Create a new sketch in Processing, in projects folder/week 1 in your local github directory.

3. Using only basic 2D primitives (ellipse, circle, rect, square, triangle) and style methods (background, fill, stroke, strokeWeight), draw a basic face. 

4. Only use the methods listed under 2D Primitives and Color in the Processing Reference. No loops, conditionals, functions, etc.

5. Once you've gotten the hang of Processing, spend about 15-20 minutes making your face. This should be fast!

6. Save your face sketch and a screenshot of the compiled result in your course directory under projects/week1.

7. Create another face, but with pencil and paper (or in a digital editing tool of your choice- ie. Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP, Inkscape, etc.) <br>

    Spend no more than 15-20 minutes on this. Don't overthink it!

8. Save a .jpg or .png of your hand-drawn face in the projects/week1 folder. If you drew it on paper, take a photo or scan it.

9. Commit your changes and push to your remote repository.

10. Open your command line and _cd_ into the directory.

11. Add all the current files in the directory:
    ```    
    git add --all
    ```
12. Commit your changes with a message:
    ```
    git commit -m "your message here"
    ```
13. Push your changes to the remote:
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```
